							This module features eight buttons, four of which are roman numerals labeled “I", "V", "X", and "L” which have the values of one, five, ten, and fifty respectively, two with the letters “W (waste) and R (recycle)”, and the last two colored red and green respectively. The red button resets the current stage, and the green button submits the answer. Lastly, there is a display which shows, in the order of submission: Paper, Plastic and Metal.
						</p>
						<p>
							To solve the module, the defuser needs to waste and recycle the correct amount of paper, plastic, and metal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Starting from zero for all values, use the following tables to determine the amount of paper, plastic, and metal present. <strong>Follow all rules until the end of the table.</strong>

						<h3>Final Instructions:</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>At any time the bar on the right becomes empty after completing a stage, IMMEDIATELY press the green button again. Otherwise, a strike will be issued and the module will reset. This cannot occur during stage 4.</strong> From all the calculated values, if any of them are negative, make them positive and follow all of the rules below:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								If the total sum of paper, plastic, and metal present is higher than 695, recycle everything.
							</li>
							<li>
								Otherwise, if the number of metal exceeds 200, recycle three-quarters and then waste the rest. Go to rule 4.
							</li>
							<li>
								Otherwise, if the number of metal is lower than the number of paper present, recycle all of the paper, waste one quarter of the metal, and recycle half of the remainder.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the number of plastic is less than 300 and greater than 100, recycle half. Go to rule 6.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the number of plastic is less than 100 and greater than 10, waste everything.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the number of paper is less than 65, waste one third unless instruction 4 was true, than recycle all of the paper.
							</li>
							<li>
								If the amount of leftovers** are less than 300 and greater than 100, recycle them. Otherwise, waste them.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							If any value ends up with a decimal, refer only to the integer of the number.
						</p>
						<p>
							Further notes: Upon submitting an incorrect amount of recycled and/or wasted material, a strike is issued and the module resets. To submit an answer, the defuser must press the green button every time to confirm their inputted amount of wasted and recycled material. A total of three green button presses are expected. A fourth green button press is expected when there are leftovers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon pressing the red button to reset, the defuser’s input of the material type for that stage will be reset. There will not be a display to show the amount the defuser has entered, so he or she must be wary.
						</p>
						<p class="footnote">*Morse code modules refer to Morse Code, Morse-A-Maze, Morsematics, and Color Morse.</p>
						<p class="footnote">**Any materials left after being modified by a rule become leftovers unless another rule refers to them again.</p>
						<p class="footnote">***The bomb time and strikes are taken from the time of the first press of the submit button and is recalculated with every strike on the module.</p>
